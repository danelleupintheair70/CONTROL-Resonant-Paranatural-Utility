"""How good is the voice grouping, measured against what a person decided.

One aggregate clustering score hides the errors that matter in a dub, so these
are reported separately:

- **B-cubed precision/recall/F1** of the groups against the reference characters;
- **incorrect merges**: groups holding a second character for at least 10% of
  their time (the expensive error: a mixed group must be pulled apart by hand);
- **missed brief characters**: characters with few lines that never get a group
  of their own (absorbed into someone else's);
- **naming precision**: if each group were named after its majority character,
  the share of lines that would be right;
- **recognition with abstention**: each line compared with prints built from the
  *other* lines (leave-one-out within the material, or other episodes when
  given); a suggestion is made only above a similarity floor and a margin, and
  precision and coverage are reported together.

A reference built from one episode measures that episode. It is not a general
accuracy claim, and callers say so.
