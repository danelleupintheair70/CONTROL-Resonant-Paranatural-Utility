"""How each line is said: the feeling, from the voice and from the picture.

Two readers, kept apart and then put side by side:

- The voice: an emotion model (emotion2vec, through FunASR) on the line's
  separated dialogue. On an anime test episode it heard how strongly a line
  is said well and what is felt less well (an excited "It went perfectly!"
  came out angry, a begging "Don't go!" happy), so it is the second opinion.
- The picture: a model that sees (``analysis.emotion_model``, a local
  ``ollama/qwen3-vl:8b`` by default) looks at a still from the middle of the
  line with the line's words and says the expression and the feeling; on the
  same episode it read faces correctly ("excited, mouth open").

The fused answer takes the picture's feeling when it saw a face, and says
whether the voice agrees; a line nobody could read stays unknown. Results
land in ``<stem>.emotion.json`` beside the script and are reused while the
lines and models are unchanged. Nothing is generated or sent to a service
other than the configured local model.
