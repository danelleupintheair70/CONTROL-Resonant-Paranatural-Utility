"""Stage 4 — speaker diarization: label who speaks each segment.

Lets Doblarr clone a distinct voice per character. Two ways to get there:

- `pyannote`: the full diarization pipeline (needs HF_TOKEN and the model
  terms accepted on HuggingFace). It finds turns in the audio itself.
- `local`: doblarr.speakers groups the already-cut lines by voice with an
  ungated embedding model. No account, nothing leaves the machine.

`transcribe.diarizer: auto` uses pyannote when a token is set and the local
grouping otherwise. Only when neither can run does a job fall back to a single
narrator voice, so teases and full dubs still run.
