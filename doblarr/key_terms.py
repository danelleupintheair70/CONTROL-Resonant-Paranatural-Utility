"""The names and terms an episode keeps saying, and whether its dub keeps them.

A translator working a batch of lines at a time renders the same term one way
here and another way twenty lines later ("the harbor" as "el puerto", then as
"la bahía"). Three parts keep a show's wording steady:

- `find` picks the key terms from the source lines with no model at all:
  phrases capitalised mid-sentence ("Lantern Exam", "Cove of the Fallen
  Leaves"), the words inside them with their lowercase uses ("cove"), and
  names with an honorific. A capitalised word that is far more often written
  in lowercase ("The", "What") is ordinary English, and a word capitalised
  only at the start of a sentence ("Hm", "Well") is not a term. Plurals count
  as one term ("Leaves" is "Leaf").
- `read_back` reads how a set of lines rendered one term: the wording that
  appears in most of the term's lines and rarely elsewhere. It works on any
  text lined up with the source: this dub's translation, or the transcript of
  an official dub track.
- `enforce` makes the decided renderings hold: every line whose source says a
  term must say its rendering, or it is rewritten (kept only when the rewrite
  does), or it keeps a finding for a person.

Matching ignores case, accents, plural endings and leading articles, so
"la Ensenada Oculta del Faro" holds in "las ensenadas ocultas del Faro".
