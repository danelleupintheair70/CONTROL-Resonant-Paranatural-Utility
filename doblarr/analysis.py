"""An episode broken down line by line, without dubbing it.

An analysis run stops where a dub would start writing: the dialogue is
separated, every line is cut (from subtitles or recognition), grouped by voice
(doblarr.speakers) and measured against its speaker's average level. This
step adds what a person needs to judge a line and a voice bank needs to pick
it:

- the line's pitch (median Hz) and how far it moves (semitones), from the
  separated dialogue, the same measures the clone reference picker ranks by;
- the original-language words. When the lines came from subtitles in another
  language (an English fansub of a Japanese show), recognition on the original dialogue
  gives the Japanese, word by word, and each word joins the line it falls in.

Everything lands in `<stem>.analysis.json` beside the script; the script keeps
the lines, speakers and levels. Nothing here is translated or generated.
