"""One validated JSON request to a language model, through Prompture.

Narrative extraction and the recommendation judge both ask a model for a typed
answer. They share this: Prompture picks native structured output or prompted
JSON, the reply is validated against a Pydantic schema, an invalid reply is
retried once with feedback and then reported as invalid (never repaired into a
guess), every request is charged to the run's request budget, and an optional
holdout guard scans the request before it leaves the process.

The model string is a Prompture one (``ollama/qwen3:8b``, ``claude/...``). The
caller decides which; nothing here picks a remote provider on its own.
