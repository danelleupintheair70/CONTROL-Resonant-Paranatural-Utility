"""How a line moves inside itself: its energy curve, pauses and peaks.

`doblarr.levels` answers "how loud was this line, compared with ordinary
dialogue". This module answers the question an envelope needs: *where inside the
line* the energy goes. It is a separate measurement with its own name and units,
because the two are computed differently:

- ``levels`` reports ``dBFS-rms-speech``: the RMS of 20 ms frame **peaks**
  (max-of-channels). It is a robust loudness figure for short utterances, but a
  frame-peak RMS is not a sample RMS, and treating it as one would mislabel it.
- this module reports ``dBFS-rms-sample``: the true RMS of the samples in each
  25 ms window, every 10 ms, on a 16 kHz mean downmix (``ffmpeg -ac 1``).

Every number states its version (``FEATURES``), frame sizes, channel policy and
smoothing. A line with too little audio, no audio, or audio that is known to be
overlapped or contaminated returns an explicit quality state and ``None`` for
what it cannot know; it never returns a confident zero.

Audio is decoded in bounded chunks (``CHUNK`` seconds), so a two-hour movie is
never held in memory at once, and a chunk is decoded once for all the lines in it.
