"""What the dialogue says about who each voice is.

People in a script name each other. "What is it, Mina?" names the person
spoken to, and the next line in another voice, a moment later, is usually
Mina answering. "Kaito-sensei!" says the speaker is not Kaito. Read over a
whole episode, these clues point at a voice group's name: the name it answers
to, and not a name it calls. That is what catches a group named after a
character the scene only talks about.

Plain text rules, no model: a candidate name is one of the show's cast (or an
alias), or a capitalised word the episode uses as a name at least twice
(called out, or with an honorific). The result is evidence shown beside the
group, never a name by itself.
