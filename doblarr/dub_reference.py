"""What a published dub of this episode says, line by line.

A file that carries a professional dub in the target language is the best
evidence there is of how that audience hears the show: the names, the jutsu,
the catchphrases, and how long each line runs when a person performs it. This
transcribes that track (faster-whisper, word timestamps) and gives each script
line the words spoken during it, mapped through the track's verified alignment
(see doblarr.track_alignment).

It is research data, never applied by itself: the result is a sidecar next to
the script, `<stem>.dubref.<stream>.json`, which review tools and reports read.
