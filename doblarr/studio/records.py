"""Versioned studio documents over the shared SQLite database.

Every write appends a revision. A caller that read revision `n` passes
`base_revision=n`; if somebody else wrote in between, the write is refused as a
conflict carrying the newer document, so the caller can merge instead of
silently replacing an edit. A document marked `frozen` accepts no further
revision at all: a judged version or a finished experiment variant is evidence,
and later work is recorded as a new record that links back to it.
