"""Casting decisions with scope: series, then episode, then single line.

A series-level choice is inherited by every episode that has not decided
otherwise; an episode can override a character; a line can override its
episode. Exceptions are always visible — the effective cast says where each
choice came from — and changing a series choice first lists which episodes
would follow it and which keep their own.

The pipeline keeps reading the existing per-title voice cast. Applying a
decision writes that cast (the one authority the synthesizer already uses) and
queues only the affected character's lines; it does not create a second cast
store the pipeline would have to reconcile.
