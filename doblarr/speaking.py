"""Who talks in a show, how much, and how.

The first thing to know about a cast is its weight: the lead who speaks 40% of
an episode needs a voice chosen with care, the guard with one line does not.
The second is range. A character heard only calmly can be cast from any clean
line; one who shouts half the time needs a voice (and a reference) that can
shout, and the lines where they do are the material a voice bank is built from.

Both come from scripts Doblarr already wrote: each line's speaker and time, and
the original actor's level against their own average (`relative_db`, measured
on the separated dialogue). Nothing is generated or re-measured here.
