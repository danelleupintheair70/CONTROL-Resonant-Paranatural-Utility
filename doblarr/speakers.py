"""Who speaks each line, without an account: voice embeddings and clustering.

pyannote's diarization pipeline is gated behind a HuggingFace token. The voice
embedding model it uses inside (WeSpeaker ResNet34, trained on VoxCeleb) is
not, and it is all a dub needs once the lines are already cut: a dub's lines
come from subtitles or from recognition, so the question is only which lines
share a voice. Each line is embedded on the separated dialogue with the chosen
voice model(s) (doblarr.voice_models) and the lines are grouped by cosine
distance.

What the grouping is tuned for, measured on a hand-labelled anime episode:
a group almost never mixes two people (purity 0.90-1.00), and one person is
sometimes split in two (the lead shouting and the lead calm). That is the cheap
error: giving both groups the same name joins them, where a mixed group would have
to be pulled apart line by line.

The other audio tracks of the same video (the dubs) can be heard too: each
dub has its own cast, so a voice two Japanese actors share is rarely shared
again in Spanish. On that episode, adding its two Spanish dubs to the
separated Japanese dialogue found 14 voices instead of 16, F1 0.88 against
0.85. A dub is used as it is in the file (no separation; its music is the same
in every line, so it moves every vector alike).

Every line's embedding is kept beside the script (`<stem>.speakers.json`), so a
named character can be found again in the next episode without re-listening.

    Only the speakers change: the cached dialogue is re-read, the lines keep
    their text, timing and raw measurements. Returns the labels before and
    after and each line's length, so names can follow the lines they were
    given to. Speaker-relative baselines depend on who is in each group, so the
    caller refreshes them (doblarr.speaker_memory.refresh_baselines).
