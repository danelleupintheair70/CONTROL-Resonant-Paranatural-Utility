"""Move name-keyed memory onto canonical identities, after a person has seen how.

Older Doblarr kept four kinds of memory under names:

- ``speaker-names:<file name>``: which voice group of an episode is which
  character, plus lines a person moved by hand;
- ``voice-tags:<folder name>``: each named character's voice print per show;
- ``voice-traits:<voice key>``: who a catalogue voice is (character, show);
- voice casts keyed by the media path a run used.

None of these names is an identity, so the migration never guesses. ``preview``
lists one action per legacy key with the evidence for it and a state:

- ``ready``: exactly one canonical target, reachable now;
- ``ambiguous``: several targets fit (two shows filed under one folder name,
  two files with one name); left alone until a person picks;
- ``unreachable``: the file it points at cannot be read here;
- ``applied``: already migrated, nothing to do.

``apply`` takes the preview's fingerprint. If anything changed in between (a
new name, a new file, another migration), the fingerprint differs and nothing
is written. Applying twice writes nothing the second time. Legacy rows are
kept: older routes and saved jobs still read them.
