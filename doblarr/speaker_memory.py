"""Who speaks, kept honest across regrouping, corrections and episodes.

Three things depend on which lines a voice group holds, and all three must
follow when the membership changes:

- **Speaker baselines.** A line's ``relative_db`` is its level against its
  speaker's ordinary dialogue. Move lines between groups and the baselines move
  too. The raw measurement of each line does not: its source span is the same,
  so it is reused and only the baselines and relative levels are recomputed.
  Overlap is speaker-relative as well (two lines of one person are not
  cross-talk), so it is recomputed with the new labels.
- **Identities.** A group a person named keeps its character when a regroup
  hands most of its speaking time to one new group; lines a person moved by
  hand are moved again after every regroup. Both are recorded as associations
  (doblarr.identity), never inferred from a label string alone.
- **Series memory.** What a revision teaches about each character's voice is
  replaced, not added again, whenever its identities change.
